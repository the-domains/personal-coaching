# Training systems 

**Injury prevention:**

* Massage
* Stretch
* Activation

**Movement preparation:**

* Activation
* Dynamic stretch
* Movement integration
* Neural activation

**Medicine ball:**

* Linear
* Rotational

**Plyometrics & Power:**

* **Plyometrics **is method of developing explosive power. It is also an important component of most athletic performances. As we ( coach and athletes) have recognized the potential of improvements plyometrics can bring to performance, BodyProject has integrated it into the overall training program in many sports and made it a significant factor in planning the scope of athletic development.
* **Power** is a combination of strength and speed, force time velocity. Power is the application of force through a range of motion (see planar training) within a unit of time. Power is essential in performing most sport skills, whether a tennis serve or a clean and jerk. Although the exact reasons that plyometrics works may still hold some mystery, it is a fact the training brings results! There is substantial evidence that combining plyometric training with a weight-training program enhanced physical development far beyond that of weight-training programs alone. You can enhance strength and speed, and avoid injury with good combined programming.

**Movement skills:**

* Linear
* Multidirectional

**Strength**

**Energy systems / Cardio:**

Is targeted to the individual' s needs and demands. each session is tailored to elicit specific training response and develop the metabolic demands required to achieve success. Our body has three energy systems to synthesise and use energy depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise, as well as the specific limitations and demands of each energy system.

Energy system Energy source By-product Duration ATP-PC system Phosphate/ Creatine Creatine max 10 sec. Lactate system Carbohydrates Lactic acid 10-120 sec. Aerobic system Carbohydrates & fat Oxygen & water + 120 sec.
